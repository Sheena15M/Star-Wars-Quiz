# Star-Wars-Quiz
Homework 4 for RCB involved creating a coding quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Being a huge Star Wars fan I decided to use Star Wars trivia questions
after Professor John said that the questions could be on any subject

# Summary
* The repository contains two HTML documents, the index holds the foundation to the quiz in addition to a separate HTML to house the high scores.
* One JS. file houses the questions and the various functions of the quiz, while the other houses functions for the high score page
* CSS was used lightly to provide stylization to the index HTML.

# Project Features
* index.html and quiz.js work together to start the quiz. There are 10 questions with 10 seconds each to answer each one and with each wrong answer you lose 10 seconds.
* highscore.html and hs.js are the landing page where the user gets to add their initials to their score and gives them an opportunity to see how they did.
